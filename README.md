# Video Ware

A modern media upload and processing platform built with Next.js, PocketBase, and background workers. Upload media files, get resilient backups to S3-compatible storage, and receive fast previews (thumbnails, sprites) while background workers prepare assets using FFmpeg and Google Cloud APIs.

## 🎯 Product Vision

Video Ware delivers a Next.js web app where users can:
- **Upload media** with progress tracking and validation
- **Get resilient backups** to S3-compatible storage
- **Receive fast previews** (thumbnails, sprites) while processing happens in the background
- **Process media** using FFmpeg and Google Cloud APIs (Transcoder, Video Intelligence)
- **Create and edit clips** with timeline composition
- **Get AI-powered video analysis** with object tracking, face detection, person detection, speech transcription, and shot change detection
- **Render timelines** to final video outputs

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: PocketBase for collections, real-time updates, authentication, and API
- **Workers**: NestJS background task processor with BullMQ for media processing (FFmpeg, Google Cloud APIs)
- **Storage**: S3-compatible bucket for originals, derivatives, and metadata
- **Shared Package**: TypeScript types, Zod schemas, and utilities used across the monorepo
- **Queue System**: Redis-backed BullMQ for reliable task processing with retries and progress tracking

## 📦 Monorepo Structure

This is a Yarn v4 workspace monorepo:

```
video-ware/
├── webapp/          # Next.js application (@project/webapp)
├── worker/          # Background worker for media processing
├── shared/          # Shared types, schemas, and utilities (@project/shared)
├── pb/              # PocketBase instance and migrations
└── docker/          # Docker configuration for deployment
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

   Or create manually:
   ```bash
   yarn pb:admin
   ```

4. **Build shared package:**

## ⚙️ Worker Architecture

The worker is a NestJS application that processes background tasks using BullMQ:

### Task Types

1. **Process Upload** (`process_upload`)
   - Validates uploaded media files
   - Generates thumbnails, sprites, and proxy videos using FFmpeg
   - Creates Media records with metadata

2. **Transcode** (`transcode`)
   - Transcodes media to different formats/resolutions
   - Supports FFmpeg and Google Cloud Transcoder
   - Generates optimized proxy files for playback

3. **Detect Labels** (`detect_labels`)
   - Orchestrates multiple Google Cloud Video Intelligence processors
   - Uploads media to Google Cloud Storage
   - Runs five independent analysis processors in parallel:
     - Label Detection
     - Object Tracking
     - Face Detection
     - Person Detection
     - Speech Transcription
   - Normalizes and stores results in structured database entities

4. **Render Timeline** (`render_timeline`)
   - Renders timelines to final video outputs
   - Composes clips according to edit lists
   - Generates rendered video files

### Processing Features

- **Parent-Child Job Orchestration**: Complex workflows split into parallel step jobs
- **Partial Success Handling**: One processor can fail while others succeed
- **Response Caching**: API responses cached to avoid duplicate calls
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates to PocketBase
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one step don't block others

## 🛠️ Key Features

### Media Processing Pipeline

1. **Upload** → User uploads file, creates Upload + File records, stores to S3
2. **Process** → Background worker validates media, generates proxy, thumbnails, sprites
3. **Transcode** → Optional transcoding to different formats/resolutions using FFmpeg or Google Cloud Transcoder
4. **Detect Labels** → Google Cloud Video Intelligence API analyzes videos with five independent processors:
   - **Label Detection**: Detects objects, activities, locations, and shot changes
   - **Object Tracking**: Tracks objects across frames with bounding boxes and keyframes
   - **Face Detection**: Detects and tracks faces with attributes (headwear, glasses, looking at camera)
   - **Person Detection**: Detects and tracks persons with pose landmarks
   - **Speech Transcription**: Transcribes speech to text with timestamps
5. **Normalize & Store** → Detection results are normalized into structured database entities:
   - `LabelEntity`: Canonical entities (e.g., "Face", "Person", "Car")
   - `LabelTrack`: Tracked detections with keyframes and metadata
   - `LabelClip`: Significant appearances meeting quality thresholds
   - `LabelMedia`: Aggregated statistics and processing metadata
6. **Timeline Editing** → Create and edit timelines with clip composition
7. **Render** → Export timelines to final video outputs

### Workspace-Scoped Tenancy

All operations occur under a `workspaceRef`:
- Users participate in workspaces via membership records with roles (owner, admin, member, viewer)
- Permissions and queries are scoped by workspace
- Supports multi-user collaboration with role-based access control

### Background Task Processing

- Resilient task queue using BullMQ (Redis-backed)
- Progress tracking and error handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Parent-child job orchestration for complex workflows
- Partial success handling (one processor can fail while others succeed)
- Observability for job states and errors
- Task status updates in PocketBase for real-time UI updates

### AI-Powered Video Analysis

The platform integrates with Google Cloud Video Intelligence API to provide comprehensive video analysis:

- **Modular Architecture**: Each analysis type (label detection, object tracking, face detection, person detection, speech transcription) runs as an independent processor
- **Cost Control**: Enable or disable processors individually via environment variables
- **Response Caching**: API responses are cached to avoid duplicate API calls
- **Normalized Storage**: Raw API responses plus normalized database entities for fast querying
- **Versioning**: Processing results are versioned to track model updates and reprocessing
- **Keyframe Extraction**: Tracks include keyframes with bounding boxes and timestamps
- **Attribute Detection**: Face detection includes attributes like headwear, glasses, and camera gaze

### Timeline Editing & Composition

- **Clip Management**: Create clips from media with time range selection
- **Timeline Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for composing clips into timelines
- **Edit List Generation**: Automatic generation of edit lists for rendering
- **Version Control**: Timeline versions track changes and enable rollback
- **Render Tasks**: Queue video rendering jobs with configurable output settings
